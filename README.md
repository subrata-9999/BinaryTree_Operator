# BinaryTree_Operator
Console based program build with Binary Tree Data Structures. Here, you can do approximately all the Binary Tree based operations.

## 💁 Features / Functionalities
  
  - Traversal(inorder, preorder, postorder)
  - Construct a tree (from inorder and preorder traversal) and (from inorder and postorder traversal)
  - Checking (is BST or not, is Balanced or not, presence of an element)
  - Finding(elements in a given range, hight, diamter. minimum and maximum Node, mirror tree)
  <br>etc...
  

## 🛠 Languages and Tools :
  - C++
  - Binary Tree Data Structure
